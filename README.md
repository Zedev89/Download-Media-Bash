# Download-Media-Bash
So I made a bash script to download Youtube videos by copy/past the link
Made that just to instantly download and send reels to the bro's group chat in seconds
IMPORTANT: Change the settings at the tok of the script before you use!!!
IMPORTANT: There are pakages you need to install being yt-dlp, ffmpeg and ffprobe

I tried with: Youtube, Instagram, Facebook
TIKTOK DOESN'T WORK FOR SOME REASONS

It can do: MP3, Crop, Resize, Compress (kinda shit looking tho)
